# NameMyDoc

NameMyDoc uses machine learning and natural language processing to intelligently classify and rename scanned documents, making document management faster and smarter. Through Sentence-BERT, a transformer-based model that generates semantic embeddings, it accurately interprets document content to ensure precise renaming. This solution was developed to help organizations reduce manual work and improve efficiency.
